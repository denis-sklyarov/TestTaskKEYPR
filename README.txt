Hi.



1) to start test -
mvn clean install -Dtoken=<token> (token you can find in my email. GitHub revoke access tokens if commit it with code)

2) report located in target/site/serenity/index.html

Project contains same tests developed according 2 different concepts:
BDD
xUnit

BDD Tests in report:
Commits service returns consistent data
Pull request returns consistent data

xUnit tests:
Test commits
Test pull requests

enjoy!)
